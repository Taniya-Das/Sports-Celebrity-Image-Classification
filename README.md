# Image-Classification-using-Machine-Learning

In this project I have used a small dataset of 5 sports celebrities and classified their images using machine learning. The data cleaning part consists of detecting face and eyes using Opencv and manually discarding some images which do no belong to the dataset. Then wavelet transform is used for feature engineering. Theses features are used for classification using various models including SVM, logistic regression and random forest.
